# **CS1332**
## **üè´ Georgia Tech's Data Structures and Algorithms Course (Fall 2022)**
Great code has its foundation built upon data structures and algorithms. One must have a deep understanding of how data structures operate and designing efficient algorithms. Implementing algorithmic techniques that efficiently manipulate data structures is the essence of CS1332.
### **Course Objectives**
- Develop more skills in Java Programming 
- Work with common data structures used in software development by coding their low-level implementation.
    - Arrays, ArrayLists,
    - LinkedLists (Singular, Doubly, Circular)
    - Stacks, Queues, Deques, Priority Queues
    - Various Trees: Binary Trees, AVL, Heaps, 2-4 Trees, etc‚Ä¶
    - Hash Maps/Tables; External Chaining and Probing
    - Graphs and their algorithms
- Become familiar with common algorithms on these data structures
    - Sorting Algorithms: Bubble, Insertion, Selection, Cocktail Shaker, Merge, Quick, Radix, etc...
    - Pattern Matching Algorithms: Brute force, Boyer-Moore, KMP, Rabin-Karp, **Gaili Rule
    - Graph Algorithms: Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Dijkstra‚Äôs Shortest Path, MSTs
    - Dynamic Programming Algorithms
- Work with Big-O notation, allowing good choices about the appropriate data structure and algorithm to use for a particular programming problem
- Improve one's ability to test and debug programs
